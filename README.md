# Dark-web-text-analysis

In this work, a dataset of articles collected from Darkweb is given. My task is to analyse the data and get the intution whats going on. 
What the people are talking without going through each an every article.

To perform the analysis, following Work is done :
1. Cleaned the text.
2. As the dataset was huge, used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for dimentionality reduction. 
3. Useed K-means clustering for clustering the articles. 
4. Used t-SNE for dimentionality reduction just for the sake of visualization.
5. On each cluster used LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for topic modeling
6. Then extracted keywords for each clusters.

In another work on same dataset.
Did an anaysis of 5 different text extractive summerization

In the last Extracted summary is created for each cluster(10).

Along with that word cloud is presented to viuslize the most important words
