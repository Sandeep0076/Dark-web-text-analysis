# Dark-web-text-analysis
In this work, a dataset of articles collected from Darkweb is given. My task is to analyze the data and get the intuition what's going on. What the people are talking without going through each an every article.

To perform the analysis, following Work is done :

Cleaned the text.
As the dataset was huge, used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
Used K-means clustering for clustering the articles.
Used t-SNE for dimensionality reduction just for the sake of visualization.
On each cluster used LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for topic modeling
Then extracted keywords for each clusters.
In another work on same dataset. Did an analysis of 5 different text extractive summarization

In the last Extracted summary is created for each cluster(10).

Along with that word cloud is presented to visualize the most important words
